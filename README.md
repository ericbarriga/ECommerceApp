## About The Project
The purpose of this project was to provide an application where users can login and purchase furniture. The users are able to sign up to access their profile and products.

Once logged in, the user add products to their cart and update the quantity in which they are purchasing.

Through checkout, the user will add their address, credit card information, and confirmation of their order creation.
